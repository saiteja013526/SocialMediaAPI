## What's Inside?

This project shows off some key backend skills and has everything you need to get going:

- **Log in safely!** We've got secure user sign-ups and logins using JWT tokens.
- **Share your thoughts!** You can create, read, update, and delete posts. All the good stuff.
- **No messy data here.** We use Pydantic to make sure all the data coming in and out is squeaky clean, and SQLAlchemy makes talking to the database a breeze.
- **It's all organized!** The project is set up in a clean way that keeps everything neat and tidy.
